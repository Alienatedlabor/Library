<strong> Lessons Learned</strong> 
<p>This project was my first experience working at any length with Javascript objects. It required use of an object constructor and methods that target objects such as Object.entries,as well as array methods. The code makes heavy use of for loops to iterate through the objects and their key value pairs.
